# Style



we need a stlye inheritance thing along side composure so were
not using 10x more react components





what if we only inject the style wrapping component around
"native" or "root" components by wrapping those in the DOM
object?



i think we only need inline-flex and inline-block
wrapping should never be a default


whats a gooe name for the difference between your children fitting or overflowing/scrolling?



Box

Block

Rows & Columns

Scrollbox ?
